# pseuxide's fork - react inspector for docker users

A version which applied shitty workaround of docker path problem for my personal use. It's a dumb way but I'd b ok as long as it works.

As [this issue](https://github.com/hand-dot/react-inspector/issues/3) from original repo states, when u involve docker in ur development, react-inspector might misunderstand the file path depend on ur Dockerfile setting.

I integrated an ugly UI to dynamically correct erroneous docker paths. This ensures path accuracy by substituting incorrect paths with the correct one u specified which effectively solves the docker path problem. up to 3 currently btw.

Specifying the domain, the replacing only takes place when current tab contains that domain in the URL.

This image is an example of my configuration which will alter the part `/app` with `/Users/pseuxide/works/instabase` of the file path only when im working on `*instabase.host*`.

## Requirements

- Installed [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- Works only with development builds.
- Source code must be stored on local disk

## How it works

The React Inspector accesses the `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` set globally by the React Devtools and finds the [React Fiber](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-react-fiber) in the HTML element that the inspector hovered over.
The React Fiber contains information about the source code that will be added during development, so we use that information to open the VSCode.
